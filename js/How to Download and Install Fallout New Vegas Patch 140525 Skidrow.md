One of the most recent and comprehensive patches for Fallout New Vegas is the patch 1.4.0.525, which was released in July 2011 for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360. This patch adds a new feature that allows players to load a save game after the endgame sequence, so they can play the add-ons and DLCs without starting a new game. It also fixes some bugs and glitches related to quests, companions, weapons, perks, achievements, and more[^3^].
 
If you want to download and install this patch for your PC version of Fallout New Vegas, you might be interested in the Skidrow version, which is a cracked version that bypasses the DRM protection and allows you to play the game without a CD key or online activation. However, downloading and installing this version might not be as straightforward as you think, so here are some steps and tips to help you out.
 
## Step 1: Download the patch file
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the patch file from a reliable source. You can find many links and torrents online that claim to have the patch file, but some of them might be fake or malicious, so be careful. One possible source that seems to be legit is this one[^2^], which was posted by a Reddit user who claims to have found it online. The file size is about 20 MB and it's called Fallout.New.Vegas.Update7.(1.4.0.525).exe.
 
Alternatively, you can also download the whole game with the patch already applied from another source, such as FitGirl Repacks[^1^], which offers a repack version of Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition with all 6 DLCs included and activated. This version is based on the GOG release of the game, which is already patched to 1.4.0.525 and does not require any crack or activation. The repack size is about 5 GB for any single language and it takes about 10 minutes to install.
 
## Step 2: Backup your save files
 
Before you install the patch or the repack version of the game, it's highly recommended that you backup your save files, just in case something goes wrong or you want to revert back to your previous version of the game. You can find your save files in Documents\My Games\FalloutNV\Saves folder. Copy them to another location or use a cloud service like Dropbox or Google Drive to store them safely.
 
## Step 3: Install the patch or the repack
 
If you downloaded the patch file only, you need to run it as administrator and follow the instructions on screen. Make sure you select the correct folder where your Fallout New Vegas game is installed, otherwise it might not work properly. The default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout New Vegas.
 
If you downloaded the repack version of the game, you need to run the setup file as administrator and choose where you want to install the game. You can also select which language files you want to download and install, depending on your preference. After that, wait for the installation to finish and check if everything is OK.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy!
 
Now you should be able to launch Fallout New Vegas from your desktop shortcut or from Steam (if you have it) and enjoy the game with the latest patch applied. You should also be able to access all the DLCs and add-ons from your main menu or from your Pip-Boy in-game. If you encounter any problems or errors, try running the game as administrator or in compatibility mode with Windows 7.
 
We hope this guide was helpful for you and that you have fun playing Fallout New Vegas with patch 1.4.0.525
