The movie follows a dollmaker named Samuel Mullins and his wife Esther, who lose their daughter Annabelle, nicknamed "Bee", in a tragic car accident. Twelve years later, they welcome a nun and six orphan girls into their home, hoping to find some solace. However, they soon discover that a demonic entity has attached itself to one of Samuel's dolls, which he had made for Bee. The doll, named Annabelle, becomes the source of terror and torment for the girls, especially Janice, who is disabled by polio and becomes possessed by the demon.
 
Annabelle: Creation is the fourth installment in The Conjuring Universe franchise, which also includes The Conjuring (2013), The Conjuring 2 (2016), Annabelle (2014), The Nun (2018), The Curse of La Llorona (2019) and Annabelle Comes Home (2019). The movie is a prequel to both Annabelle and The Conjuring, and connects to the other movies through various references and Easter eggs. The movie received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its atmosphere, scares, performances and improvement over its predecessor. It also grossed over $306 million worldwide against a budget of $15 million.
 
If you are a fan of horror movies and The Conjuring Universe, you should definitely watch Annabelle: Creation. It will give you chills and thrills as you witness the dark origins of one of the most iconic horror dolls in cinema history.

The movie also benefits from the direction of David F. Sandberg, who previously helmed the horror hit Lights Out (2016). Sandberg demonstrates a keen sense of pacing, atmosphere and suspense, as he builds up the tension and dread with effective camera work, sound design and editing. He also knows how to stage some memorable set pieces, such as a game of hide and seek gone wrong, a scarecrow coming to life and a nightmarish encounter in a dumbwaiter. Sandberg also avoids relying too much on jump scares or gore, instead opting for more subtle and creepy ways to unsettle the viewers.
 
The movie also features some solid performances from its cast, especially the young actresses who play the orphan girls. Talitha Bateman and Lulu Wilson stand out as Janice and Linda, who share a believable and touching friendship that is tested by the demonic forces. Bateman does a great job of portraying Janice's vulnerability, curiosity and eventual transformation, while Wilson conveys Linda's loyalty, courage and innocence. Stephanie Sigman is also good as Sister Charlotte, who tries to protect the girls and uncover the truth behind the doll. Anthony LaPaglia and Miranda Otto are effective as the grieving parents who harbor a dark secret.
 
Annabelle: Creation is not without its flaws, however. The movie sometimes relies on clichÃ©s and tropes of the genre, such as characters making stupid decisions, doors slamming shut by themselves and predictable twists. The movie also suffers from some logical inconsistencies and plot holes that may raise questions among more attentive viewers. For example, why would the Mullinses keep the doll in their house after knowing what it can do? Why would they invite a group of vulnerable girls into their home if they wanted to protect them? How did the doll end up in the antique shop from the first movie? Some of these questions may be answered in future movies, but they still detract from the overall coherence of the story.
